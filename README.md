## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codebasics/py.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired directory.
3. The tutorials are in the form of Python scripts (`.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).
4. To run the Python scripts, you'll need Python installed.
5. To run the Jupyter notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for `.ipynb` files)
- Required libraries for specific tutorials (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow). These can be installed using `pip`. Some projects might have a `requirements.txt` file.
